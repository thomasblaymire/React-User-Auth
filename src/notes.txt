Authentication
===============

Back End Server Setup
=======================
React just requires data in JSON format.

Cookies
- Unique to each domain
- Cannot be sent to different domains
- Automatically included in all HTTP req by default

Token (Latest)
- Have to manually wire up
- Can be sent to any domain


Redux form
============
npm install --save redux-form

1. In the component export the default reduxForm with name and fields
2. Import reducer from redux-form within the reducers index.js
3. ES6 change import names within file import { reducer as form } so this is now refered to as form

Redux Thunk Middlewhere Library
============
An action creator always returns an object.
The object is what we call an action and the action has a type.

uness... you install Redux thunk

Redux thunk allows you to return a function from an action creator instead of an action.
It is Automatically called for us with the dispatch method.
Dispatch accepts an action and then forwards it across to all the reducers in the application.

CORS (Cross Origin Resource Sharing)
============
Browser secuirty feature to prevent header manipulation.
No permanent fix for the clinet side apart from temporaty Chrome Plugins.
Fix generally server side to allow connections API.
npm install --save cors
add in the server config require module and add app.use(cors())

LocalStorage &JWT
============
localStorage is storing something to the users local device or machine.
We must save the JWT to the browser so when a user re-visits we can read that in and authenticate.
localStorage is unique to the domain
